                    Two Choices<br><br>

            What would you do?....you make 
            the choice. Don't look for a punch
             line, there isn't one. 
            Read it anyway. My question is: W
            ould you have made the same choice?
          At a fundraising dinner for a school
           that serves children with learning disabilities,
             the father of one of the students
              delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by 
             all who attended. After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a question:
           'When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature does, is done with perfection.
            Yet my son, Shay, cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot understand
             things as other children do.<br><br>
           Where is the natural order of things in my son?'
            The audience was stilled by the query.
           The father continued. 'I believe that when a child like Shay, who was mentally and physically disabled comes into the world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself, and it comes in the way other people treat that child.'
           Then he told the following story:
           Shay and I had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay asked, 'Do you think they'll let me play?' I knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but as a father I also understood that if my son were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be accepted by others in spite of his handicaps.
            I approached one of the boys on the field and asked <br>(not expecting much) if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and said, 'We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning.'
           Shay struggled over to the team's bench and, with a broad smile, put on a team shirt. I watched with a small tear in my eye and warmth in my heart. The boys saw my joy at my son being accepted.
            In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three.
           In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the right field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as I wav ed to him from the stands.
           In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again.<br><br>
           Now, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.
            At this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game?
            Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.
            However, as Shay stepped up to the<br><br>
            plate, the pitcher, recognizing that the other team was putting winning aside for this moment in Shay's life, moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least make contact.
            The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed.
            The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay.
            As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right b ask to the pitcher.
            The game would now be over.<br><br>
            
                    The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman.
                    
                    Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game.
                    Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the first baseman's head, out of reach of all team mates.
                    
                    Everyone from the stands and both teams started yelling, 'Shay, run to first!
                    
                    Run to first!'
                    
                    Never in his life had Shay ever run that far, but he made it to first base.
                    
                    He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled. The game would now be over.
                    
                    The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman.
                    <br><br>
                    Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game.

                    Run to first!'
                    
                    Never in his life had Shay ever run that far, but he made it to first base.
                    
                    He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled.
                    Everyone yelled, 'Run to second, run to second!'
                    <br><br>
                    Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and struggling to make it to the base.
                    
                    B y the time Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had the ball .. the smallest guy on their team who now had his first chance to be the hero for his team.
                    
                    He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions so he, too, intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman's head.
                    
                    Shay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners ahead of him circled the bases toward home.

             All were screaming, 'Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay'
             
            Shay reached third base because the opposing shortstop ran to help him by turning him in the direction of third base, and shouted, 'Run to third!
            
            Shay, run to third!'<br><br>
            As Shay rounded third, the boys from boevery single day to help realize the 'natural order of things.'
            
            So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a choice:
            
            Do we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass up those opportunities and leave the world a little bit colder in the process?
         A wise man once said every society is judged by how it treats it's least fortunate amongst them.
           You now have two choices:
            
            1. Pass the Love around<br><br>
            
            2. Ignore it and keep doing what you do 
            .. and regardless either choice.. May your day, be a Shay Day. 
            We all send thousands of jokes through the e-mail without a second thought, but when it comes to sending messages about life choices, people hesitate.
            
            The crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion about decency is too often suppressed in our schools and workplaces.
            
            We all have thousands of opportunities every single day to help realize the 'natural order of things.'
